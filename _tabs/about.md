## Welcome, user!

My name is Emily Astranova (**she/her**), and I spend my time exploring the fascinating (and often frustrating) world of offensive cybersecurity. This blog is going to be my personal logbook, a place to dump thoughts, document projects, and share the things I'm learning as I navigate this field.

**What can you expect here?**

Well, it'll be a bit of a mix, reflecting the different hats we often wear in this industry:

- **Things I'm Learning:** Notes, insights, and walkthroughs of concepts, tools, or techniques I'm currently digging into. Expect stuff from basic principles to more advanced topics.
- **Homelab Shenanigans:** Building, breaking, and fixing things in my own lab environment. From setting up virtual networks to testing exploits in a cyber range, the triumphs and the facepalms will likely be documented here.
- **Networking Nightmares:** Networking is fun... until its not. I'll have things on protocols, (mis)configurations, and network security concepts.
- **Random Useful Tidbits:** Those little commands, scripts, configurations, or just random pieces of knowledge that make life easier or solve a niche problem. If I find it useful, maybe you will too.

Think of this as my public notebook. It helps me solidify my understanding, and hopefully, some of it might be useful or interesting to others passionate about cybersecurity, technology, or just tinkering.

So, grab your preferred caffeinated beverage, and let's get started. Looking forward to sharing the journey!

Stay tuned.
